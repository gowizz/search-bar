### Search box

This component allows you to create a fully functional search bar that forwards the query to the Gowiz search engine.
By default this component does not require any properties and it renders as follows.

#### Auto complete

The search bar has an autocomplete functionality that attempts to predict the next query.

```javascript
import { Searchbox } from '@gowiz/searchbar';

const search_box = (
  <Searchbox
    query={'mars'}
    searchSuggestions={[
      'mars',
      'marshal',
      'marshall',
      'marsh',
      'marshmallow',
      'marsupial',
      'marsala',
      'marshalling',
      'marseille',
      'marshy',
    ]}
  />
);
```

The characters that the users would want to type next are set to bold

Actions allow the user to perform certain actions faster by utilizing the keyboard.

| Key           | Action                                                                          |

| Esc           | Closes the suggestions list                                                     |

### Search bar

From the UI perceptive search bar looks identical to the searchbox, but they have different functionality. The search bar
allows you to harness the power of the Gowiz search engines, by accessing its search results. The users on your site can
perform searches and retrieve answerer to them without ever leaving the site.

#### Required arguments

| Argument | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API_KEY  | A unique string that determines the author of the application        |
| onSubmit | A function that handles the search results provided by the searchbar |

To get your API_KEY, please send us an <a href="mailto:karl.gustav1789@gmail.com?subject=Searchbar%20API_KEY"> email</a>

#### Example response

```javascript
  {
      "status": "success",
      "duration":1300,
       "data": [
               {
                  "title": "Example domain",
                  "url":"https://example.org",
                  "meta":"Example Domain. This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. ...",
                  "favicon":"https://example.org/favicon.ico"
              },
             ...
          ]
  }
```

The status indicated where the request was successful. If the API_KEY is valid and the application respects the agreement,
then usually a response is present. The status is different, if the API_KEY is invalid or when then ther's an issue on
our side.
The duration measure the difference between the time the search request was sent and the time when request was sent from
the server side. Duration is measured in milliseconds.
The data field is a list of search results that were retried from the server. Every search result has a title and a URL
and some of them have a meta description and a favicon.
